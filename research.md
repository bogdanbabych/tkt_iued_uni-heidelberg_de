### Current research projects

Our research projects include

#### Linguistics of Machine Translation and translation technologies

- MT of argumentative text: translating resources for non-linear discourse organisation structures
- Linguistic phenomena and terminology in MT: ontologies, phraseology, linguistic constructions

#### Resources, evaluation and optimisation of translation workflows

- Automated identification of MT errors in mission-critical areas: medical, technical, legal
- Task-based MT evaluation and error analysis (Machine Translation of specific task-oriented domains and text types, e.g., instruction manuals, argumentation, jokes; corpus-based linguistic construction analysis; methods for quantifying cognitive effort in understanding and correcting MT)
- Translation corpora and resource development for low-resourced languages and domains (morphosyntactic and lexical annotation, MT and automated error correction for automated creation of Machine Learning resources)

#### Applications

- Intelligent support for authorship in non-native language
- Next generation translation memories and hybrid MT (language-specific linguistic analysis, sub-tree matches, terminological injection, automated error analysis and error correction, multi-engine Machine Translation)
