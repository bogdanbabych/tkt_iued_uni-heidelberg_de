### Collaboration with academic and industrial partners

Our collaboration is focussed on developing and evaluating linguistic technologies and resources for professional translation. We are open to discussing ideas, synergies and prospective projects, as well as suggestions of topics for our students research. Our case studies, students' term papers, BA, MA and PhD theses can result in project reports, developing open resources and technologies with permissive / copyleft licences for commercial use, or paid internships and consultancy by our students and staff.

Our collaboration projects include (also see our [Technologies](techlabs.md) page):

- Comparative human and automated evaluation and error analysis of commercial MT systems
- Prototype development of technologies for Natural Language Generation (NLG) with corpus collocation chains and for intelligent access to shared translation resources
- Automated induction of morphosyntactic resources for low-resourced languages and domains
- Creating and evaluating domain-specific parallel corpora for MT and ML
